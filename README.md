# EC-optimization-by-Pyomo
The electrocoagulation (EC) technique is an electrochemical-based water and wastewater treatment technology that uses electricity, 
mainly in two forms of direct and alternating current (DC and AC) to produce metal coagulants in-situ by dissolving sacrificial electrodes.
The effectiveness of the EC process depends on several factors, such as current density, initial pollutant concentration, initial pH of the solution, and electrolysis time. Pollutant removal efficiency and operating costs are the main objective functions of the EC process, which generally should be maximized or minimized, respectively.
Python optimization modeling objects (Pyomo) is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating, solving, and analyzing optimization models. In this repository, you will find the codes from the Pyomo library, which introduce a set of optimal operating conditions for the EC process.
